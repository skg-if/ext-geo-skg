# Research product extended by GEO-SKG

{: .important }
To prevent possible clashes with other extensions, each extension is assigned a unique prefix (e.g., the acronym you provided upon requesting an extension) that you need to prepend when defining new properties and relations for core entities. For this extension, the acronym is `geo_skg`.

By default, this extended core entity inherits all the properties defined in the core base entity extended(e.g., [Research product]).
Here below, please describe the new properties and relations that the extension adds to the default [Research product].


## Properties

### `geo_skg_property`
*List* (optional): a description.

```json
    "geo_skg_property": ...
